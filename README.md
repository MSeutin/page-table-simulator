# page-table-simulator

## In Progress
- I made a python file named `pt-sim-python.py` where the logic will go.
- Running `make` will copy `pt-sim.sh` to `pt-sim`.
- Inside of `pt-sim.sh` my python file will execute.

## To Do
- I need to figure out how to make the input interactive 
- Rest of logic comming up...
